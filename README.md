# Optimised Primes

> There's more to them than meets the eye.  
> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Optimus Prime

A Python notebook to look at different prime generating algorithms in an interactive slideshow using
[RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE).

Starting from the most na√Øve algorithm, and slowly improving it to arrive at a reasonably optimised and clever
algorithm that I found on a page that has been taken down and only exists in the wayback machine
[here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710134640/http://diditwith.net/2009/01/20/YAPESProblemSevenPart2.aspx).

## Installing / Running

Before running the first time, run the `setup.sh` script to install dependencies and plugins,
then run `jupyter notebook` to start the notebook server,
and in the browser window that opens click on `Primes.ipynb` to load the notebook.

Evaluate the first cell (select it then press `shift+Enter` or `ctrl+Enter`), and then click the

button to start.
